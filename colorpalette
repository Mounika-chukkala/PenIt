Visual Style Guide: Blog UI Design
Focused exclusively on stylistic elements typography, color, spacing, imagery, branding, and 
mood to create a cohesive, engaging reading experience.
1. Typography
Font Choices & Pairing:
● Headings: Bold sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Figtree, or Manrope) for modernity and hierarchy. 
Nike’s blog uses sans-serif headlines for energy 1.
● Body Text: Serif fonts (e.g., Lora, Source Serif, or Merriweather) enhance long-form 
readability. Medium and Smashing Magazine favor serifs for warmth 5  12.
● Pairing Principle: Contrast sans-serif headings with serif body text (e.g., Inter + Lora). 
Notion’s blog combines sans-serif titles with serif prose for balance 7.
Spacing & Sizing:
●Base Sizing: Body text at 16–18px (mobile: 16px, desktop: 18px).
●Line Height: 1.5–1.7 for body, 1.2–1.3 for headings.
●Letter Spacing: Headings at -0.5px (tight), body at 0.3px (relaxed).
● Variable Fonts: Adjust weight/width dynamically (e.g., for dark mode transitions) 5 10.
2. Color Palette
Core Combinations:
●Background: Warm neutrals (e.g., #F9F5F0 beige) or deep grays (#121212). KonMari’s 
blog uses soft creams for tranquility  1 2.
●Foreground: High-contrast text (e.g., #2A2A2A on light, #E0E0E0 on dark).
●Accents: Ruby red (#B73225), teal (#4DA8DA), or ochre (#FFD64C) for links/tags. Behr’s 
2025 "Rumors" red adds depth 2 6.
Harmony & Contrast:
● Follow 60-30-10 rule: 60% neutral, 30% secondary, 10% accent.
● Ensure WCAG 4.5:1 contrast for accessibility. Tools: WebAIM Contrast Checker 10.
● Example: Pinterest’s pastel accents on white space create visual calm  1.
3. Spacing & Layout Rhythm
White Space & Padding:
●Margins: 48–64px between sections; 24px around text blocks.
●8pt Grid System: All spacing multiples of 8px (e.g., 16px, 24px, 32px). Ramp’s blog uses 
consistent padding for scannability  1 7.
Vertical Rhythm:
●Baseline grid: Align text to 4px increments.
●Headings: 2rem (h1), 1.5rem (h2) with 32px top margin.
●Paragraphs: 24px bottom margin.
4. Imagery & Media Styling
Consistency Rules:
●Aspect Ratios: Uniform thumbnails (e.g., 16:9 for features, 1:1 for avatars).
●Borders/Shadows: Subtle 4px radius, 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1) drop shadows. Nike’s blog 
uses full-bleed images with no borders for impact 1.
●Overlays: Dark 30% overlay on hero images for text legibility.
Dynamic Elements:
● Progressive Blurs: Soft focus on background visuals to prioritize content 3.
● 3D Objects: Interactive models (e.g., product rotations) for tech blogs 8.
5. Visual Consistency & Branding
Iconography & Line Styles:
●Icons: Minimalist, 16px stroke weight (e.g., Feather Icons set).
●Lines: 1px borders with #EAEAEA for dividers.
Brand Integration:
● Color/Shape: Use brand accents in CTA buttons; circular shapes for friendly tone.
● Dark Mode: Shift neutrals to deep grays, reduce saturation in accents (e.g., ruby → 
terracotta). Notion’s blog maintains brand blue in both modes 7 10.
6. Design Tone & Mood
Style Examples:
● Clean & Minimal (e.g., KonMari): Ample white space, monochrome palette  1.
● Editorial (e.g., Medium): Classic serifs, pull quotes in accent colors.
● Modern Tech (e.g., Vercel): Bold sans-serifs, gradient accents 8.
● Whimsical (e.g., A Beautiful Mess): Organic shapes, hand-drawn icons 11.
Long-Form Readability:
●Line Length: 60–80 characters (cardioid layout for focus).
●Calming Elements: Warm off-whites (#FDF8F5), fluid section transitions 6 8.
Inspiration & Tools
● Real Examples: Nike Stories (bold visuals), Ramp Blog (clean typography)  1 7.
● Style Guides: Material Design, Happy Hues for palettes 6 10.
● Dribbble Trends: Kinetic typography, bento grids 3 12.
Focus on emotional resonance through cohesive styling whether serenity (soft greens) or energy 
(vibrant reds) to align with content intent 2 8. follow these rules and that theme and give me the most appealing ui by making some changes to ui without disturbing the logic buddy give me the components modified when i give you the component..
